## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**
   - Add gold to one main button first
   - Test thoroughly
   - Then expand to other elements

2. **Use Hierarchy**
   - Gold solid = Most important (primary CTAs)
   - Gold outline = Important (secondary CTAs)
   - Silver = Alternative actions
   - Blue = Standard (fallback)

3. **Don't Overuse**
   - Premium elements lose impact if everywhere
   - Use strategically for high-value items
   - Less is more for luxury feel

4. **Test on Mobile**
   - Always check real mobile devices
   - Touch interactions differ from hover
   - Responsive styles included

5. **Monitor Performance**
   - Track CTR changes
   - Watch engagement metrics
   - Adjust based on data

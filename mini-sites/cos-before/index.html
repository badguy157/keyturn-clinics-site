                <h2>Our Facial Enhancement Procedures</h2>
                <p>The face is the first thing people notice about you and it plays a crucial role in how you are perceived by others and how you feel about yourself. Over time, the natural aging process causes the skin to lose elasticity, wrinkles to form, and facial volume to diminish, which can make you look tired, sad, or older than you actually feel. Our facial enhancement procedures are designed to address these concerns and help you regain a more youthful, refreshed, and vibrant appearance that reflects how you feel on the inside. We offer a wide variety of facial procedures including facelifts, brow lifts, eyelid surgery, rhinoplasty, chin augmentation, cheek implants, and non-surgical treatments like Botox, dermal fillers, chemical peels, and laser skin resurfacing.</p>

                <h3>Facelift Surgery - Turn Back the Clock</h3>
                <p>A facelift, also known as rhytidectomy, is one of the most popular and effective cosmetic surgery procedures for addressing the visible signs of aging in the face and neck. During a facelift procedure, excess skin is removed, underlying tissues are tightened, and facial muscles are repositioned to create a more youthful and natural-looking appearance. The results of a facelift can be truly dramatic and can take years off your appearance while still maintaining your natural features and expressions. Our board-certified plastic surgeons have performed thousands of facelift procedures and have the skill and artistry necessary to deliver beautiful, natural-looking results that will make you look and feel younger without looking like you've had work done. Recovery time varies from patient to patient but most people are able to return to normal activities within two to three weeks after surgery.</p>

                <h3>Rhinoplasty - Nose Reshaping Excellence</h3>
                <p>Rhinoplasty, commonly referred to as a nose job, is a surgical procedure that reshapes the nose to improve its appearance and/or function. Many people are unhappy with the size, shape, or proportions of their nose and rhinoplasty can address a wide range of concerns including a nose that is too large or too small, a bulbous or drooping tip, a crooked or off-center nose, a bump or depression on the bridge, asymmetry, or breathing difficulties caused by structural abnormalities. Our experienced plastic surgeons use advanced surgical techniques to create a nose that is in harmony with your other facial features and enhances your overall appearance. Whether you want subtle refinement or dramatic transformation, we can help you achieve the nose you've always wanted. The procedure is typically performed under general anesthesia and takes about two to three hours depending on the complexity of the case.</p>
                
                <h3>Non-Surgical Facial Rejuvenation Options</h3>
                <p>Not everyone is ready for or needs surgical intervention to achieve their aesthetic goals. That's why we offer a comprehensive menu of non-surgical facial rejuvenation treatments that can deliver impressive results with minimal downtime and no scarring. Botox injections are one of the most popular non-surgical treatments and work by temporarily relaxing the muscles that cause wrinkles, resulting in smoother, younger-looking skin. Dermal fillers are another excellent option for restoring lost volume, filling in deep wrinkles and folds, and enhancing facial contours. We also offer chemical peels which exfoliate the skin and stimulate collagen production for a brighter, more even complexion, as well as laser treatments that can address a variety of skin concerns including sun damage, age spots, redness, and fine lines.</p>

                <h2>Body Contouring & Enhancement Procedures</h2>
                
                <div class="floating-badge special">LIMITED!</div>
                
                <p>Sometimes diet and exercise alone are not enough to achieve the body shape you desire. Stubborn pockets of fat, loose or sagging skin, and loss of volume in certain areas can all contribute to a less-than-ideal body contour that can affect your confidence and self-esteem. Our body contouring procedures are designed to help you achieve a more sculpted, toned, and proportionate physique that you can be proud of. We offer a full range of body enhancement procedures including liposuction, tummy tuck surgery, breast augmentation, breast lift, breast reduction, arm lift, thigh lift, and buttock augmentation. Each procedure is customized to meet your specific needs and goals and our surgeons have the expertise to deliver beautiful, natural-looking results that enhance your overall appearance.</p>
                
                <div class="image-placeholder">[Image Placeholder 4]</div>
                
                <h3>Liposuction - Remove Unwanted Fat Deposits</h3>
                <p>Liposuction is one of the most commonly performed cosmetic surgery procedures in the world and it's easy to see why. This versatile procedure can remove stubborn fat deposits from virtually any area of the body including the abdomen, flanks, hips, thighs, buttocks, arms, back, and even the chin and neck. Liposuction is not a weight loss procedure but rather a body contouring technique that can help you achieve a more sculpted and defined appearance. The procedure involves making small incisions in the treatment area and using a thin tube called a cannula to suction out unwanted fat cells. Modern liposuction techniques are safer and more effective than ever before and can deliver dramatic results with minimal scarring and relatively short recovery times. Most patients are able to return to work within one to two weeks after the procedure.</p>
                
                <h3>Breast Augmentation - Enhance Your Feminine Curves</h3>
                <p>Breast augmentation, also known as augmentation mammoplasty, is a surgical procedure that increases the size and improves the shape of the breasts using breast implants or fat transfer. Many women choose breast augmentation to enhance their natural breast size, restore breast volume lost after pregnancy or weight loss, achieve better breast symmetry, or improve their overall body proportions. During your consultation, we will discuss your goals and help you choose the right implant type, size, shape, and placement to achieve your desired look. We offer both saline and silicone gel implants in a variety of sizes and profiles to ensure that you get the results you want. The procedure is typically performed under general anesthesia and takes about one to two hours to complete. Most patients experience some swelling and discomfort for the first few days after surgery but are able to return to normal activities within a few weeks.</p>

                <h3>Tummy Tuck - Flatten and Firm Your Abdomen</h3>
                <p>A tummy tuck, medically known as abdominoplasty, is a surgical procedure that removes excess skin and fat from the abdomen and tightens the underlying abdominal muscles to create a flatter, firmer, and more toned midsection. This procedure is ideal for individuals who have loose or sagging abdominal skin as a result of pregnancy, significant weight loss, aging, or genetics. Even people who exercise regularly and maintain a healthy diet may have difficulty achieving a flat abdomen due to stretched skin and separated abdominal muscles that cannot be corrected through diet and exercise alone. A tummy tuck can address these issues and give you the flat, tight stomach you've been working towards. The procedure typically takes two to three hours and is performed under general anesthesia. Recovery time varies but most patients are able to return to work within two to four weeks.</p>

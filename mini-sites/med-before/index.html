                <h3>Botox - The Gold Standard for Wrinkle Reduction</h3>
                <p>Botox is the most popular cosmetic treatment in the world and has been used safely and effectively for decades to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles caused by repetitive facial movements and expressions. When injected into specific facial muscles Botox works by temporarily relaxing those muscles and preventing them from contracting which smooths out existing wrinkles and prevents new ones from forming. The treatment is quick comfortable and requires no downtime so you can return to your normal activities immediately after your appointment. Results typically become visible within a few days and can last for three to four months or even longer with regular maintenance treatments. Our experienced injectors have performed thousands of Botox treatments and have the skill and artistry necessary to deliver natural-looking results that enhance your appearance without making you look frozen or overdone.</p>

                <h3>Dermal Fillers - Restore Volume and Fullness</h3>
                <p>As we age our skin naturally loses collagen elastin and hyaluronic acid which leads to volume loss sagging and the formation of deep wrinkles and folds that can make us look older and more tired than we actually feel. Dermal fillers are an excellent solution for addressing these age-related concerns because they work by adding volume beneath the skin to fill in wrinkles smooth out folds and restore youthful contours to the face. We offer a variety of different filler products including Juvederm Restylane Radiesse and Sculptra each of which has unique properties and benefits that make them ideal for treating specific areas of the face. During your consultation we will assess your facial anatomy and discuss your goals to determine which filler or combination of fillers will give you the best possible results.</p>
                
                <h3>Lip Enhancement - Achieve Fuller More Beautiful Lips</h3>
                <p>Full plump lips are considered a sign of youth and beauty but many people are born with naturally thin lips or experience volume loss in the lips as they age. Lip enhancement with dermal fillers is a quick and easy way to add volume and definition to the lips creating a fuller more sensual appearance that enhances your overall facial aesthetics. The treatment takes just a few minutes to perform and results are visible immediately although there may be some minor swelling for a day or two after the procedure. We can create subtle natural-looking results or more dramatic fuller lips depending on your personal preferences and aesthetic goals.</p>

                <h3>Laser Hair Removal - Say Goodbye to Unwanted Hair</h3>

Laser hair removal is a safe effective and long-lasting solution that can permanently reduce hair growth on virtually any area of the body including the face legs arms underarms bikini area and more. The treatment works by delivering targeted laser energy to the hair follicles which destroys them and prevents future hair growth. Most patients require a series of treatments spaced several weeks apart to achieve optimal results but once the treatment series is complete you can enjoy smooth hair-free skin without the need for ongoing maintenance.

                <h3>Microdermabrasion & Skin Rejuvenation</h3>
                <p>Microdermabrasion is a gentle non-invasive exfoliation treatment that uses fine crystals or a diamond-tipped wand to remove dead skin cells from the surface of the skin stimulating cell turnover and promoting the growth of fresh new skin. This treatment is excellent for improving skin texture reducing the appearance of fine lines minimizing pore size and creating a brighter more radiant complexion. Microdermabrasion is comfortable requires no downtime and can be performed in as little as thirty minutes making it a perfect lunchtime treatment.

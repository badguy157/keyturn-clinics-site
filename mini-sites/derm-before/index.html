            <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/250x180/1E90FF/FFFFFF?text=Treatment" alt="treatment" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 15px 15px;">
            <p>We provide a full spectrum of dermatological services including medical dermatology, cosmetic dermatology, and surgical dermatology. Our medical dermatology services cover the diagnosis and treatment of skin diseases such as acne, rosacea, eczema, psoriasis, skin infections, and autoimmune skin disorders. We also perform comprehensive skin cancer screenings and mole evaluations to detect melanoma and other skin cancers at their earliest stages when they are most treatable. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment outcomes, and we recommend annual skin checks for all our patients, especially those with a family history of skin cancer or significant sun exposure.</p>

            <p>Our cosmetic dermatology services help patients look and feel their best. We offer a variety of anti-aging treatments including Botox, dermal fillers, chemical peels, microdermabrasion, and laser treatments. These procedures can reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, improve skin texture and tone, and restore a more youthful appearance. Our dermatologists have extensive training in cosmetic procedures and use the latest techniques to achieve natural-looking results. We also offer laser hair removal, vein treatments, and scar revision to address a variety of cosmetic concerns. Each treatment plan is customized to your individual goals and skin type to ensure optimal results.</p>

            <h3>Advanced Treatment Options</h3>
            <p>For patients with more complex skin conditions, we offer advanced treatment options including biologic therapies for psoriasis and eczema, phototherapy for various skin disorders, and Mohs micrographic surgery for skin cancer removal. Mohs surgery is a precise surgical technique that removes skin cancer layer by layer, examining each layer under a microscope until only cancer-free tissue remains. This technique has the highest cure rate and preserves the maximum amount of healthy tissue, making it ideal for skin cancers on cosmetically sensitive areas like the face. Our dermatologic surgeon has performed thousands of Mohs procedures and is highly skilled in this specialized technique.</p>

            <p>We also specialize in treating pediatric dermatology conditions, helping children with eczema, birthmarks, warts, and other common skin problems. We understand that children have unique needs and we make every effort to ensure their visits are as comfortable and stress-free as possible. Our pediatric dermatology services include treatment for acne in teenagers, birthmark removal, and management of genetic skin disorders. We work closely with pediatricians and other healthcare providers to ensure comprehensive care for our youngest patients.</p>
            
            <p>In addition to our clinical services, we offer a range of medical-grade skincare products to help maintain healthy skin between visits. Our dermatologists can recommend the best products for your skin type and concerns, whether you're looking for anti-aging solutions, acne treatments, or daily skin protection. We carry professional skincare lines that are only available through dermatology offices and have been proven effective through clinical research. Proper home skincare is an essential component of any treatment plan, and we're here to guide you in selecting the right products for your individual needs.</p>
